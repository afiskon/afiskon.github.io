[PGConf.Russia][pgconf-ru] is a major annual conference which is entirely
dedicated to PostgreSQL. This year it gathered more than 600 people from around
the world. The conference takes place in Moscow and is hosted by [Postgres
Professional][pgpro] company.

Another Russian conference worth mentioning is [PGDay.ru][pgday]. Although lately
it's dedicated to database management systems in general (including MySQL,
Oracle, ElasticSearch, etc) [last year][ly] there were many talks related to
PostgreSQL. The conference takes place in Saint Petersburg in July and is hosted
by [Data Egret][de] company.
