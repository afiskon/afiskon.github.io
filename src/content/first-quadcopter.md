OK, it looks like I've finished assembling and configuring my first
quadcopter. At least, it breaks away from a floor and seems to do it
smoothly (finally!). Here is a short video:

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3B-indZPFo?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Now I only have to wait for a proper weather. Currently in Moscow it's about
-2 C and a bit snowy or sometimes rainy. Meanwhile any pieces of advice before
a first flight would be very appreciated!

P.S. I know it's a bad practice to fly a quadcopter at home and I'm sorry for
doing it.
