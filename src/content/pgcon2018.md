At PGCon 2018 that took place last week (29.05-01.06) my colleague Anastasia and
I [gave a talk][talk] "Growing up new PostgreSQL developers: On teaching
students, team leading, project management and stuff". Here are the slides:

Other talks presented by colleagues of mine:

* [Credereum - blockchain-enabled Postgres][talk1] by Alexander Korotkov;
* [Jsonb flexible indexing][talk2] by Teodor Sigaev;
* [Towards scalable ACID PostgreSQL with partitioning, postgres_fdw and logical
  replication][talk3] by Anastasia Lubennikova;

The last talk was actually submitted by Arseny Sher. Unfortunately Arseny
couldn't attend the conference this time thus Anastasia replaced him.

As always, I would like to share a few random photos I took while being in
Ottawa:

This was my [second][scnd] PGCon. What I can't understand is how Canadians
managed to build such a great society. It's just as if one day everyone gathered
and agreed "let's do right things and don't do wrong things" and prospered ever
after. Canada is most beautiful and peaceful place I know and I wish I could
visit this country more often!
