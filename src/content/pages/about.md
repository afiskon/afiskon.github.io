Hi! My name is Aleksander Alekseev. I'm living in Moscow, Russia and I'm a
software developer.

My interests include but are not limited to open source software, functional
programming, distributed systems, electronics, blogging and
[podcasting](http://devzen.ru/). I'm a contributor to PostgreSQL, FreeBSD and
various other open source projects.

Currently I'm working in [Postgres Professional](https://postgrespro.com/)
company as a full-time PostgreSQL core developer.

You can contact me via email [afiskon@gmail.com](mailto:afiskon@gmail.com).
