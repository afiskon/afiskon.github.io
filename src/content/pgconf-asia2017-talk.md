[Oleg Bartunov][ob] and I have been invited to the [PGConf.ASIA
2017][pgconf-asia] conference that took place 4-6 December in Tokyo, Japan. Both
of us attended the [developer unconference][unc]. Also Oleg had an honor to be a
keynote speaker and I gave a talk "PostgreSQL Sharding and HA: Theory and
Practice".  Right after the talk a few people asked me to share the slides, so
here they are:

This is the first time I have visited Japan. I was surprised how hospitable
Japanese people are. Everyone was very friendly and kind to me, I felt really
welcomed. Also I liked Japanese food very much. The real Japanese noodles,
sushi or sashimi taste nothing like those you might try somewhere else.

This was a great experience. Unfortunately I didn't have much time for
sightseeing. So I'll definitely return to Japan some day!

Also I would like to share a few random photos with you. Here they are:
