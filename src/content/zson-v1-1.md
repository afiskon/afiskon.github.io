[ZSON][zson] is a PostgreSQL extension for transparent JSONB compression. The
compression is based on the common dictionary of strings that are frequently
used in JSONB documents. In some cases ZSON can significantly reduce the
database size and improve the overall performance. For more details see [this
benchmark][bm]. ZSON is an open source software distributed under the MIT
license.
