Here is how I lerned to fly a quadcopter:

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZSfcD3hiRQ?ecver=2" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" style="position:absolute;width:100%;height:100%;left:0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Good to know it actually **can** fly :) Up until now I was not sure about it.

This is the second version of the quadcopter. The first one didn't work because
I choose components that are not supposed to work together or even be used in
quadcopters. Lesson learned - if you doubt, better ask more experienced people
on the corresponding forums.
