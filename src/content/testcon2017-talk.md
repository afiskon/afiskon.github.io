My colleague Anastasia Lubennikova and I were invited to the conference
[TestCon Moscow 2017][u1] to tell how PostgreSQL is developed and tested.
In case you are interested in this topic here are the slides:

There was a video camera in the room so I got a strong feeling that the
recording will be available on YouTube shortly. Meanwhile if you got any
questions about the conference, the talk or the slides please don't hesitate
to left them in the comments section below.
